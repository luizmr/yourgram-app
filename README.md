## üíª About project

Personal project built using ReactJS with Firebase. It is an application where you can edit the name and the color of your gram and when you close and go back to the page, it is all saved in local storage. You can also upload jpeg and png images, which will be saved in firebase. So, you can access your personalized "gram" everywhere (images at least). It also uses framer motion for some effects in the progress-bar, image uploading and settings container.
